Dockerfiles
===========

A collection of Dockerfiles that can be included into other Dockerfiles to 
build various, related Ubuntu images for Docker. This is also an attempt 
to codify best practices.

Creating uniform includable files means that Docker image creation
will take full advantage of the Docker caching mechanism.


Getting Started
---------------

Before building any images, you need to specify who you are, as the
maintainer of the images you'll be creating:

    echo "MAINTAINER Your Name <email@address.com>" > baselines/Maintainer


Building Images
---------------

Then, to build the Docker Images, just go into one of the subdirectories
and run:

    cpp -I.. Dockerfile.in -o Dockerfile
    docker build .

Depending how deep you are in the hierarchy, the `-I..` command
needs to refer to the root of the hierarchy. Otherwise, the preprocessor
won't be able to find the files to include.

**Recommended:**

To enable the APT package cache (which is a very good idea),
on your Docker host machine, run:

    sudo apt-get install -y squid-deb-proxy squid-deb-proxy-client

And add the following line to the squid-deb-proxy configuration /etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl:

    # PPAs
    ppa.launchpad.net

And restart the proxy:

    sudo restart squid-deb-proxy

When building the Docker Images, run:

    cpp -I.. -DENABLE_APT_CACHE Dockerfile.in -o Dockerfile
    docker build .

This should speed builds up considerably, by caching various .deb 
packages locally.
